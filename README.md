# TronxyX8BoardCase

Procedural motherboard case for the cxy-v2-0508 (Tronxy X8 board) created using [cadquery](https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery).

To generate a custom stl you should edit and compile the file `TronxyX8BoardCase.py`. To compile the file `TronxyX8BoardCase.py` i suggest using [CadQuery GUI](https://github.com/CadQuery/CQ-editor).
Compiling can take some minutes because creating the hexagonal mesh is slow. You can comment out the hex mesh code for testing your parameters and reenable it for the final stl.
